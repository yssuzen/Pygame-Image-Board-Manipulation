# Pygame-Image-Board-Manipulation

This Python code uses Pygame library to create a window that displays an image and allows the user to manipulate the image using their mouse. The user can left-click on any point of the image and apply a board effect to the area surrounding the click.

To run the code, you need to have Pygame library installed. The image file should also be in the same directory as the Python code.

The main function of this program is board(), which takes the window, width, height, x, and y coordinate of the mouse click as arguments. It then applies a board effect to the area around the click point.

The program runs an infinite loop until the user closes the window. When the user clicks on the image, the board() function is called with the coordinates of the mouse click. The pygame.display.update() function is called to update the window after the board effect is applied.

The code is commented to explain each step of the program.

This code is useful for anyone interested in image manipulation with Python and Pygame.
